__Finding optimal irrigation dates for deficit irrigation using AQUACROP-OSPY__
This report explores the efficacy of using Aquacrop OSPY to evaluate different irrigation schedules under deficit conditions. Aquacropp-OSPY is a Python implementation of an open source version of the Aquacrop model developped by the Food and Agricultural Organization. The introduction provides an overview of the climate and agricultural production of Tunisia, reviews the development of Aquacrop, Aquacrop-OS and Aquacrop-OSPY, and reviews the concept of deficit irrigation. The second section implements the Aquacrop-OSPY crop model to run 200 randomly chosen two-date irrigation combinations under the following conditions 1) three applications of 10 mm, 2) three applications of 20 mm and 3) three applications of 25 mm. The third section selects 5 date intervals of particular interest based on the literature. In the discussion section these results are compared to data on winter wheat (durum what) harvests in Tunisia and the impact of climate is examined.
