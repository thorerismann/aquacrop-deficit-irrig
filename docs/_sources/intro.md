__Implementing AQUACROP-OSPY to test the effects of varying irrigation quantity and timing on yield of winter wheat in the Tunisian climate__
This report explores the efficacy of using Aquacrop OSPY to evaluate different irrigation schedules under deficit conditions. Aquacrop-OSPY is a Python implementation of an open source version of the Aquacrop model developped by the Food and Agricultural Organization. The introduction provides an overview of the climate and agricultural production of Tunisia, reviews the development of Aquacrop, Aquacrop-OS and Aquacrop-OSPY, and introduces the concept of deficit irrigation. The Aquacrop-OSPY module is then used to generate 1500 runs of the model (500 baseline runs and 1000 testing runs) varying irrigation dates and irrigation quantitaties. The data are visually inspected and an initial signifance test is evaluated.
