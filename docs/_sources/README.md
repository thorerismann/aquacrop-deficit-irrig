# Deficit Irrigaiton with Aquacrop-OSPY

See the Deployment [here](https://thorerismann.github.io/aquacrop-deficit-irrig/intro.html)

This report explores the efficacy of using Aquacrop OSPY to evaluate different irrigation schedules under deficit conditions. Aquacrop-OSPY is a Python implementation of an open source version of the Aquacrop model developped by the Food and Agricultural Organization. The introduction provides an overview of the climate and agricultural production of Tunisia, reviews the development of Aquacrop, Aquacrop-OS and Aquacrop-OSPY, and introduces the concept of deficit irrigation. The Aquacrop-OSPY module is then used to generate 1500 runs of the model (500 baseline runs and 1000 testing runs) varying irrigation dates and irrigation quantitaties. The data are visually inspected and an initial signifance test is evaluated.

For installation of the Aquacrop package please follow the instructions provided by Aquacrop-OSPY at the repository [here](https://github.com/aquacropos/aquacrop). The notebooks require a few additional packages, for statistics and for plotting.

The data generated by the model runs can be accessed under the /model_results foder. The figures used in the report (and more) can be foud in the /figures folder. The code used to generate the model runs is in the /notebook folder. The notebooks which import this data and generate the charts and anylsis are also available in the /notebook folder.
