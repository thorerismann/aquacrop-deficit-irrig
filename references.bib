abstract = {Across the United States, human and environmental demands for water resources have increased significantly over the last 50years. Population and economic growth, changing social norms regarding the importance of water quality and ecosystems, and longstanding Native American water-right claims have increased pressures on available water supplies, particularly in the arid western states. Given that agriculture accounts for roughly 85% of US consumptive water use, growing water demands with relatively fixed water supplies have heightened conflicts over agricultural allocations in water-short years. Sustainability of U.S. irrigated agriculture will depend partly on whether producers adopt more efficient irrigation “production systems” that integrate improved onfarm water management practices with efficient irrigation application systems. It will also depend on how well future conservation policy integrates improvements in onfarm water conservation with watershed/landscape-scale water-management institutions that help to encourage market-induced water reallocations supporting real water conservation.}

abstract = {Crop-growth models are powerful tools for supporting optimal planning and management of agricultural water use globally. However, use of crop models for this purpose often requires advanced programming expertize and computational resources, limiting the potential uptake in integrated water management research by practitioners such as water managers, policymakers, and irrigation service providers. In this article, we present AquaCrop-OSPy (ACOSP), an open source, Python implementation of the crop-water productivity model AquaCrop. The model provides a user friendly, flexible and computationally efficient solution to support agricultural water management, which can be readily integrated with other Python modules or code bases and run instantly via a web browser using the cloud computing platform Google Colab without the need for local installation. This article describes how to run basic simulations using AquaCrop-OSPy, along with more advanced analyses such as optimizing irrigation schedules and evaluating climate change impacts. Each use case is paired with a Jupyter Notebook, which offer an interactive learning environment for users and can be readily adapted to address a range of common irrigation planning and management challenges faced by researcher, policymakers and businesses in both developed and developing countries (https://github.com/thomasdkelly/aquacrop).}

abstract = {This article introduces the FAO crop model AquaCrop. It simulates attainable yields of major herbaceous crops as a function of water consumption under rainfed, supplemental, deficit, and full irrigation conditions. The growth engine of AquaCrop is water-driven, in that transpiration is calculated first and translated into biomass using a conservative, crop-specific parameter: the biomass water productivity, normalized for atmospheric evaporative demand and air CO2 concentration. The normalization is to make AquaCrop applicable to diverse locations and seasons. Simulations are performed on thermal time, but can be on calendar time, in daily time-steps. The model uses canopy ground cover instead of leaf area index (LAI) as the basis to calculate transpiration and to separate out soil evaporation from transpiration. Crop yield is calculated as the product of biomass and harvest index (HI). At the start of yield formation period, HI increases linearly with time after a lag phase, until near physiological maturity. Other than for the yield, there is no biomass partitioning into the various organs. Crop responses to water deficits are simulated with four modifiers that are functions of fractional available soil water modulated by evaporative demand, based on the differential sensitivity to water stress of four key plant processes: canopy expansion, stomatal control of transpiration, canopy senescence, and HI. The HI can be modified negatively or positively, depending on stress level, timing, and canopy duration. AquaCrop uses a relatively small number of parameters (explicit and mostly intuitive) and attempts to balance simplicity, accuracy, and robustness. The model is aimed mainly at practitioner-type end-users such as those working for extension services, consulting engineers, governmental agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and various kinds of farmers associations. It is also designed to fit the need of economists and policy specialists who use simple models for planning and scenario analysis.},

abstract = {Crop simulation models are valuable tools for quantifying crop yield response to water, and for devising strategies to improve agricultural water management. However, applicability of the majority of crop models is limited greatly by a failure to provide open-access to model source code. In this study, we present an open-source version of the FAO AquaCrop model, which simulates efficiently water-limited crop production across diverse environmental and agronomic conditions. Our model, called AquaCrop-OpenSource (AquaCrop-OS), can be run in multiple programming languages and operating systems. Support for parallel execution reduces significantly simulation times when applying the model in large geospatial frameworks, for long-run policy analysis, or for uncertainty assessment. Furthermore, AquaCrop-OS is compliant with the Open Modelling Interface standard facilitating linkage to other disciplinary models, for example to guide integrated water resources planning.}
